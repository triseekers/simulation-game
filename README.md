Poo Poo Man is a clone of the game Simon. There are four colored buttons on the screen. The buttons light up in a certain random pattern, and then the player must repeat this pattern by pressing the buttons in the correct order. Each time the player successfully simulates the pattern, the pattern gets longer. The player tries to match the pattern for as long as possible.
